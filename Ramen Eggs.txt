0. Sear some chicken, pork or steak in the pan with butter or sesame oil and a spicy rub for your ramen topping.

2. Add Green Onion and a thin pat of Butter, just to coat the Green Onions.
3. Deglaze the pan with Soy Sauce.
4. Add a dash or two of Fish Sauce, and a splash of the Mirin.
5. Reduce for a minute or two, until it's a very dark, thick, opaque sauce. Careful, there's not much there.
6. Scrape the pan with a rubber spatula into a small finger/serving bowl. There should maybe be 2 Tablespoon of sauce.
7. Add Olive Oil, Butter or Sesame Oil to the pan to fry the Egg.
8. Once hot, crack the Egg onto the hot oil.
9. Turn the pan down to Low (3 of 10). 
10. Add the Salt, Black Pepper, Chili Powder and Thyme.
11. Cook one side of the Egg. Use a rubber spatula to lift the edges in preparation for the flip.
12. Flip the egg.
13. Turn burner heat OFF.
14. Slide Egg out of pan onto bowl of ramen.
15. Pour a healthy dash of Mirin as dressing over the egg.
