 TIRAMISU


0. Ingredients

8 egg yolks
1/4 cup sugar
(2) Sara Lee Poundcakes - Located in your grocer's dessert freezer.
6 oz of Coffee Liqueur
6 oz of Espresso
2 cups Heavy Whipping Cream
4 Tablespoons Sugar
(2) 8 oz tubs of Marscapone Cheese
1/2 Rich, bittersweet Chocolate Bar (75%+ Cacao)


1. Zabaglione

In a double boiler, beat egg yolks and sugar with an electric mixer. Work up to the highest setting; beat until smooth, yellow, soft mounds form. (About 5-10 minutes.)
Put directly into the refrigerator.


2. Lady Fingers

Slice poundcake into < 3/8" thick pieces.
Layer the pieces along the bottom of a 9 x 9" dish.


3. Coffee Liquid

Mix equal parts Espresso and Coffee Liqueur. You can't have too much of either!
Transfer to a squeeze bottle if you have it, otherwise spoon Coffee Liquid over poundcake layer. Ensure each piece gets pretty soaked.


4. Whipped Cream

Whip the cream and sugar in their own large bowl until stiff peaks form. Make soft whipped cream; not too fluffy. 
You want to eat it, not use it as mortar.


5. Filling

Take the zabaglione out of the fridge.
Taking a spatula, fold the marscapone cheese into the zabaglione.
Once the color and texture is pretty even, fold in the whipped cream.


6. Build It

- Shave/microplane bittersweet chocolate over the poundcake. It should be tiny, tiny flakes and chunks. Just a sprinkle of bitter to counter all the sweetness.
- Using the spatula, spread the Filling over the layered poundcake.
- Sprinkle with a very light layer of cinnamon.
- Repeat with the next layer of poundcake, coffee liquid, chocolate bits, filling & cinnamon. Two thick layers is plenty, but if you cut the poundcake thinly, you may be able to get three layers of this.
