# TIRAMISU

## Ingredients

- 8 egg yolks
- 1/4 cup sugar
- (2) Sara Lee Poundcakes - Located in your grocer's dessert freezer.
- 6 oz of Coffee Liqueur
- 6 oz of Espresso
- 2 cups Heavy Whipping Cream
- 4 Tablespoons Sugar
- (2) 8 oz tubs of Marscapone Cheese, set out at room temperature.
- 1/2 Rich, bittersweet Chocolate Bar (75%+ Cacao)

## METHOD

### 0. Coffee Liquid

Mix equal parts Espresso and Coffee Liqueur. You can't have too much of either! Transfer to a squeeze bottle if you have it.

### 1. Whipped Cream

Whip the cream and sugar in their own large bowl until stiff peaks form. Make soft whipped cream; not too fluffy. 
You want to eat it, not use it as mortar.

### 2. Zabaglione

In a double boiler, beat egg yolks and sugar with an electric mixer. Work up to the highest setting; beat until smooth, yellow, soft mounds form. (About 5-10 minutes.)

### 3. Filling

Using a spatula, fold the marscapone cheese into the zabaglione. It's easier when warm.
Once the color and texture is pretty even, fold in the whipped cream.

### 3. Lady Fingers

Slice poundcake into < 3/8" thick pieces. Or use Lady fingers.

### 4. Assemblage

- Layer the pieces or dry Lady fingers along the bottom of a 9 x 9" dish.
- Pour Coffee Liquid over poundcake layer. Ensure each piece gets pretty soaked.
- Shave/microplane bittersweet chocolate over the poundcake. It should be tiny, tiny flakes and chunks. Just a sprinkle of bitter to counter all the sweetness.
- Using the spatula, spread half the Filling over the layered poundcake.
- Repeat with the next layer of poundcake, coffee liquid, chocolate bits, and filling. Two thick layers is plenty!
- Sprinkle a heavy layer of cinnamon on top.
- Refridgerate until serving.
