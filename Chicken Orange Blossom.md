4. Add the chicken pieces, one at a time coating each with the marinade.
5. Place the chicken in a Dutch Oven, or heavy iron pan with a lid. Pour in any remaining marinade.
6. Push a smashed Garlic clove into the sauce next to each piece of chicken.
7. Push the Green Cardamom pods into three places around the outside.
8. Snap the Guajillo Chili in half and push both pieces in between the chicken near the center.
9. Drizzle the chicken with a little Soy Sauce.
10. If you want to outdo yourself, place an orange slice on each chicken thigh.
11. Put the lid on, or otherwise cover, and bake for 55 mintues.
