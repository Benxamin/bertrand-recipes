# Ginger Dressing

This is in-progress recipe from a Bennihana "copy-cat recipe" that was just a list of ingredients.
I tried to start with 50% oil and 50% vinegar, like a standard salad dressing. But the result was too oily.
If you notice at the restaurant, it's very thin, but it does coat. It looks like a watery, gingery Thousand Island dressing.
I also feel like "tomato paste" and "salt & pepper" are euphemisms for "ketchup" and "MSG". 

Onion and oil are the base. Celery provides bulk, vinegar is the main component. It's seasoned with ginger, ketchup, lemon and soy sauce.

## INGREDIENTS

### PRODUCE

- 1/4 White Onion, small.
- 1 Celery Stalk, trimmed, chopped.

- 2 Tbsp Soy Sauce
- 2 Tbsp Rice Wine Vinegar

### DRY GOODS

- 1 Tbsp Ketchup
- 1 Tbsp Sugar
- Salt
- Pepper

## METHOD

1. Add all ingredients into a standard blender and PULSE until blendable.
2. Blend on high for 2-3 minutes to really emulsify and shred the plant fibers.
3. Pour into serving bowl and spoon over lettuce salad.
