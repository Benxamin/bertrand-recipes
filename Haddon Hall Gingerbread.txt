NOTES
-----
2020-11-11: I made tonight with 6/4 cups High-protien whole wheat bread flour
    and 1 cup all-purpose flour. 
Had to substitue 1/2 cup Molasses with 1/2 cup dark corn syrup. 
Substituted Shortening with Cocnut Oil.
At high altitude, the center did not bake well, and was slightly underdone. 
A center strip stuck to the bottom of the loaf pan whne dumping it. 
While cooling, as we ate dessert, the center continued to collapse. 
It needed to go longer in the oven, and rise a little more.
