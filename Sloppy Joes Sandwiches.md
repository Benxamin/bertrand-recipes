# SLOPPY JOES

This recipe comes from a blog article about how "Sloppy Joe's" is a real bar in Cuba, and has been recently restored to it's former glory. 
The recipe is basically "tropical chili", but the Lime zest does a lot of heavy lifting. Goes great on a bun with sliced Dill Pickles and Pepper Jack cheese.
