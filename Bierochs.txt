BIEROCKS

1 lbs Ground Beef
1 lbs Ground Pork (mild savory/breakfast)
1 White Onion, halved, sliced
1/2 head White Cabbage

2 Cloves Garlic
2 cups Sauerkraut
1 Tbsp Black Pepper

1 Package Rhodes Bread rolls.



The Russian in my office calls them "bee-ROKES."

I always make several huge batches in the autumn; then freeze them.
They’re made in advance, so they’re quick to eat on Halloween when
there’s a lot of commotion in the house.

We use 50/50 ground beef/pork, onions, and sauerkraut in addition to the
cabbage. Be careful with the salt when using the kraut, though. And if
you must sauce them: mustard, never ketchup. And cheese is verboten.

Over the years, I’ve made them with bison, veal, bratwurst and lamb. My
personal favorite is bratwurst and garlic with sauerkraut. (You just
remove the link casings.)
- Bison needs the fat and flavor of the savory ground pork, but no
  kraut.
- Lamb works with cilantro really well (plus mushrooms) for a Russian
  twist (like a pirojki). I could see ketchup with these.
- Veal, garlic, cinnamon, golden raisins, pine nuts, cabbage (no kraut)
  for a Mediterranean version.
I put caraway seeds in sauerkraut when I make it as a side dish, and
adding them to bierocks just got the seeds stuck in your teeth. Not
really worth it. If you want rye flavor, use rye dough! (Which is
awesome, btw.)
