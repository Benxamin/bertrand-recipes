### Cooking
Everything herein was prepared by myself many times. Sometimes for my wife, my children or extended family, particularly around the holidays. But always for the enjoyment of cooking unto itself. When you have the timeline planned, the ingredients procured and prepared, the knives sharpened, the ovens ready; _mise en place_. Then you can relax, and get into the flow. The self-imposed race against the clock, the attention to cooking ingredients, cueing up the next steps, applying water and minerals to dissected flora and fauna in the presence of changing temeratures. It is basic; it is essential. 

### Cooking Evolves
Each time your prepare a dish, there are small variations. And if a modified preparation of the dish is better, I'll change the recipe.

### Trancendant Cooking
There is a bit of losing yourself to being in the present with your Cooking. Fire on, anxiety gone. Your focus is consumed by your senses. If not for the pleasure of it, then for the sheer safety of it. If you are not present while cooking, you can ruin more than your meal! Part of this focus is control; an exercise of will. One takes raw ingredients, and ensures they transform in just the right ways to fullfill a desired achievement. You must even measure your own reaction to the chemistry taking place in front of you. A little more of this, a little less of that, faster, slower, aromas rising, oils spattering, the fruit of the Earth transforming in front of you. You become a Supreme Magus at your kitchen altar transcending mere sustenance in the perpetual race against eternity. Your DNA will live on. And, with careful instruction, theirs will, too. We carry our cooking culture onward through time. 

### Celebration Cooking
I acknowledge the holy days of cultures around the world, and practice the ones close to home. I celebrate the changing seasons. Asparugus and eggs in the Spring. Rhubarb and smoked meats in the summer. The end of summer when the hatch chilies roast, and the summer sausage is ground, and bratwurst and ball games abound. Apples in Autumn, and storing up a bountiful harvest. Citrus, nuts and roasts in the Winter. Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners are truly magical. 


## Memories
For a full life, I recommend a hike or run to establish flow within the body. Then, a bit of yoga right after to release any deeper blocks or stresses. Then prepare a meal, as small as a cup of tea, or many courses as you have need for. Finally, enjoy the meal. Even when not shared with acquaintances, afficianados, friends or family, your meals become a very strong, very deep well of memories that will enrich your life. Do your best to make good ones! For what do we truly have but our memories?
