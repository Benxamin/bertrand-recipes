THANKGIVING MASTER SHOPPING LIST


APPETIZERS
----------
Keep it simple. No one likes dips, spreads, or seafood. They're too hard to eat. 
Cubed cheeses, sliced meats, crackers, olives and pickles are it.
I'm adding some crudité. No dips. No brie.

PICKLES

- Gherkins, sweet. You can also get dill if you have time.
- Black Olives, whole. Smallest can!
- Green olives that taste like black (olive bar)
- Green Olives stuffed with Gorgonzola (olive bar)
- Some Kalamatas, pitted! (olive bar)
- Peppers, sweet/hot (olive bar)

CHEESES

- Beemster (really old Gouda, X-O or Graskaas), Dutch.
- Double Gloucester (Herbs & Green Onion) English.
- Smoked Mozzeralla, Italian.
- Cornish Kern (cheesemongers voted this the best cheese in the world 2017).
- Balsamic washed Parmesean

CHARCUTERIE

- Boar's Head Salami
- Thicker sliced Procuitto
- Diced Ham, but really sweet and/or smokey


BAR & COCKTAILS
---------------
Howie likes wine with dinner at events like this, where we do wine all night.
Limit bar choices to one really good Scotch, Bourbon or Whiskey, Vodka, Gin.
Don't do Sherry, Port or Brandy unless you have the glassware. For the
dishwashers it's just another needless thing.

- Whiskey: Jack Daniel's, Jameson Irish Whisky, George Dickel.
- Bourbon: (Sweet Potatoes: 1/2 cup) Jim Beam Black (my house well bourbon).
- Scotch: Balvenie 12
- Vodka: Belvedere, or Tito's (my house well vodka). Stoli black/gold is THEE BEST if you can find it. And Kettle One is nice, too. 
- Gin: Bombay Sapphire. There simply is no other gin.

Always have on hand:
- Club Soda
- Tonic
- Simple Syrup
- Vermouths
- Bitters


BEER
----
George Helstrom likes beer. Of course, we haven't any. For two years in a row.
Bottles only, cans are too trashy for a formal feast. And I don't want to wash
any more glasses!

- Ale: Boulevard - whatever comes out of their Tank #7.
- Pilsner: Heinekin, Urquell, MGD Light.

WINE
----
Whatever Howie brings, usually a red he's into (Granache, Cotes du Rhone, Zin) 
and a stylish Prosecco.

WHITE
-----
- Sauvignon Blanc. 
- Chardonnay (1 bottle for the Turkey)
- Prosecco. (2 Bottles) It's the only thing everyone can agree on!

RED
---
- Beaujolais - French: Chénas, Fleurie, Gamay, Regnie
- Granache - Spain: Las Rocas (pick a good vintage), Argentina: El Toro
- Zinfandel - Calfironia: 7 Deadly, Ravenswood


FOOD
----
We've done this a few times, and aren't stressed anymore. 
In fact, it's kind of relaxing to cook all day.
