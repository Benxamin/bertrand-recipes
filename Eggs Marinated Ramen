# Eggs Marinated Ramen

## Ingredients

- 4 Cups Water
- 2 Cups Soy Sauce
- 1 Cup Mirin
- 1 Cup Sake

- 1 Bunch Green Onions, sliced
- 2 Cloves Garlic, smashed

- 12 Eggs
- Salt

## Method - Marinade

1. Combine all ingredients in a sauce pan or small pot. 
2. Bring to a boil.
3. Turn heat down to low and simmer for 20 minutes.
4. Skim the garlic and onions, or pour through strainer into large container.
5. Keep both Eggs and Marinade in a large lidded container in the fridge.

## Method - Eggs

1. Fill a stock pot over halfway with cold tap water.
2. Add a lot of salt, more if you are at high altitude.
3. Bring to a boil.
4. Set each Egg into the boiling water so that they do not crack.
5. Set a timer for six minutes.
6. Bring back to a boil, and reduce to simmer.
7. Remove Eggs after six minutes and place in an ice bath (cold water, ice and salt).
8. Cool Eggs for 30 minutes. Ensure they are cold before you peel them, so that the egg white proteins are set and less likely to tear.
9. Peel Eggs and place into Marinade.
10. Marinate Eggs for 48 hours. Longer will make them too salty; shorter will not embed enough flavor.
