Remy's Potato Leek Soup

INGREDIENTS
-----------
2 Tblsp Butter
1 Yellow Onion, medium, diced

3 Leeks, finely chopped
2 Tblsp Butter

3 Cloves Garlic
1 1/2 Tbsp Thyme, Fresh
Salt and Pepper

4 Potatoes, Yukon Gold, chopped.

1 Box Vegetable Stock (32 oz)

1 Quart Half and Half (Light Cream)

Method
------
1. In a Stock Pot over medium heat (5 of 10) melt the butter, then add the onion. Cook until the onions are translucent, about 15 minutes.
2. Add more Butter and the Leeks. Cook until the Leeks are completely soft. 15 minutes.
3. Add the Garlic and Thyme, and cook until everything looks almost like green mush in the pot. About five more minutes.
4. Add Salt and Pepper to taste.
5. Add the Potatoes and cook until they are hot. At least seven minutes.
6. Then, add the Vegetable Stock and bring to a simmer. At least 20 minutes.
7. Turn off heat. Blend soup with an immersion blender until pur√©ed. 
8. Add Half and Half. 
9. Add more Salt and Pepper, as the cream tends to flatten the flavor a bit.
10. Bring to a simmer and serve. OR...

At this point, you can cover with plastic wrap and the lid, and refrigerate for up to three days. 
I like to make this soup at least a day ahead to give the flavor time to develop.  

## Reheat

Put on Low heat (3 of 10) for about 30 minutes.
To ensure that you don't get distracted and burn it, set a timer for 11 minutes. Then stir the soup. 
Then set the timer for 7 minutes, and stir. And continue for each prime number: 5, 3, 2, 1. 
Oh the math? 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 = 29.

Serve with Fougasse, or your favorite crusty bread.
