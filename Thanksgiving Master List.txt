THANKGIVING MASTER SHOPPING LIST


APPETIZERS
----------
Keep it simple. No brie (unless it's baked in pastry or crumble topping).
Cubed cheeses, sliced meats, crackers, olives, pickles and other crudites.
Alessi brand bread and sesame sticks with herbed cream cheese are a great new addition.

PICKLES

- Gherkins, sweet. You can also get dill if you have time.
- Black Olives, whole. Smallest can!

From the Olive Bar (one per quest, plus two):
- 10 Green olives that taste like black
- 10 Green Olives stuffed with Gorgonzola
- 10 Some Kalamatas, pitted!
- 10 Peppers, sweet/hot, red or yellow

CHEESES

- Beemster (really old Gouda, X-O or Graskaas), Dutch. The Wisconsin style is creamy, but doesn't have the aged flavor, or deep color.
- Double Gloucester (Herbs & Green Onion) English.
- Smoked Mozzeralla, Italian.
- Cornish Kern (cheesemongers voted this the best cheese in the world 2017).
- Balsamic washed Parmesean, keep some shavings for the brussel sprouts.

CHARCUTERIE

Take these out of the fridge first thing in the morning, let them come to room temp to roll. Roll them slightly cone shaped so that they fan when layed-out next to each other. Place a wooden spoon over them to prevent unrolling as you go. Once they're prepped, put them back into the fridge on their platter.

- Genoa Salami, thin sliced
- Procuitto, thin sliced
- Most any other salaumi, thin sliced
- Diced Ham, but really sweet and/or smokey


BAR & COCKTAILS
---------------
We just open the wine right away so we don't need all this other stuff. 

- Bourbon: (Sweet Potatoes: 1/2 cup) Jim Beam Black
- Vermouth: Sweet White (1/2 cup Green Beans)

BEER

Bottles only. Some fresh, local brew if you can get it.
George Helstrom (R.I.P.) loved beer. Of course, we didn't have any. For two years in a row!!

- Ale: Boulevard - whatever comes out of their Tank #7.
- Light Lager: Bud Light
- Pilsner: Heinekin

WINE

Whatever Howie brings, usually a red he's into (Granache, Cotes du Rhone, a 12% Zin) and a stylish Prosecco.

- Chardonnay (1 bottle for the Turkey)
- Prosecco. (2 Bottles) It's the only thing everyone can agree on!
