\f0\fs24 \cf0 Your Checkout page could be improved. 1) The green bar is functionless. If you want a visual anchor, add a touch of color to the logo. Currently, it distracts as a broken progress indicator. 2) The cards aren't in any clear hierarchy. It reminds me of those messy pinterest/tumblr layouts. Cards everywhere. Which one is complete? Which ones do I still need to do? The "Submit" button is still broken, but there's no clear indication of what's next...  \
3) And yes, I want a discount. But don't spam me. When I log into your site just apply your discounts. Merchandising should change for the logged-in user. I mean, you have a database, right? You know when my last order was, if ever? So present the appropriate sale for a first-timer, old-timer or frequent shoppers. Don't make me track down some cheap little code. }
