This version has five parts:
1. Marinate chicken
1. Par-boil rice
1. Fry onions
1. Fry chicken
1. Combine and cook.

## INGREDIENTS

### Marinade

- 1 cup Yogurt, full fat
    OR...
- 3 Tblsp Cooking Oil
- 3 Tblsp Vinegar

- 1 Lemon, juiced
- 4 Garlic cloves, paste
- 1-2 Tblsp Ginger, fresh, paste

- "Shan" brand Tandoori spice mix
    OR...
- 1 Tblsp Garam Masala, the good brown kind, that gets hotter the more you eat it. Not the cheap, red kind with Paprika filler! NO PAPRIKA!
- 1 Tblsp Chili Powder
- 1 tsp Tumeric, powder
- 1 tsp Salt
- 1 tsp Black Pepper
- 1 tsp Cayenne Pepper

- 1.5 lbs Chicken Thighs, Breast or other meat.

### Rice Spice

- 2 Bay Leaves
- 8 Green Cardamom pods, gently hand-pressed until they crack.
- 8 Cloves
- 2 Star Anise
- 2 tsp Salt. This is an absolutely must have. If the salt does not get into the rice, then all your flavor building will be for naught.

### Frying Spices

- 5 Tblsp High-temp Vegetable Cooking Oil
- 1 Bay Leaf
- 1 Cinnamon Stick
- 8 Cloves
- 4 Green Cardamom Pods, cracked
- 1 Star Anise
- 2 Mace pieces, large
- 1 Tblsp Cumin Seeds
- 1 Black Cardamom Pod
- 1 Medium Red Onion, halved crosswise, then thinly-sliced lengthwise about the center.

### Combined Cooking

- Fried Onions (above)
- 1/2 bunch Cilantro, coarsely chopped
- 1/2 bunch Mint, coarsely chopped
- 1/2 bunch Parsely, flat-leaf, chopped OPTIONAL.
- 4 Tblsp Butter or Ghee, melted

## METHOD

### Marinate Chicken

__You can use **any** savory chicken marinade that use yogurt and lemon juice. Done.__

OR...

Combine spices, yogurt, lemon juice, and chicken pieces.
Let it sit for 30 minutes in the fridge.

### Par-Boil Rice

1. In a 3-4 quart pan with a lid, add Rice and Salt. 
1. Add Water so that the rice is just covered.
1. Add the Rice Spices, and stir them in. Be careful to keep the Bay Leaf intact.
1. Cover, and set heat to Med-Low (4 of 10) for about 15 minutes.
Check that the Rice is at least half-cooked.

### Fry Onions

1. Add 5 Tblsp of a higher-temperature vegetable oil (Avocado or Coconut oil) to a large, flat-bottomed pan or Dutch oven.
1. Set the heat to Med-Low (4 of 10).
1. Add the Frying Spices. Stir to cover them with hot oil.
1. Once they are fragrant, sprinkle in all the sliced Red Onions.
1. Cook until the Red Onions are translucent, about 20 minutes.
1. Turn up the heat to Med-High (6 of 10). 
1. Keep stirring the Red Onions frequently, so that they do not get dark brown and bitter. 
1. Remove the fried onions to a paper towel-lined plate.
1. Remove as much of the Frying Spices as you can.

### Cook Chicken

1. Add chicken pieces slathered in marinade to the hot pan. 
1. Let them brown on one side.
1. When you flip the chicken pieces, add some extra marinade. 
1. Then splash in some beer or wine, chicken stock or water, and/or duck fat to loosen the marinade. The end goal is to have chicken in a curry sauce.
1. Add Salt to the sauce, and more Garam Masala to increase the hot spiciness.
1. Once the chicken is cooked-through, and the sauce is reduced, set the heat to Low-High (3 of 10).

### Combine and Cook

1. Sprinkle the Rice over the Chicken in the pan, until covered and out of Rice.
1. Drizzle with Saffron thread milk.
1. Drizzle with melted Butter or Ghee.
1. Sprinkle with chopped green herbs (Cliantro, Mint, Parsley).
1. Sprinkle with Fried Onions.
1. Cover with lid for 30 minutes on Low-High (3 of 10).
1. Ensure Rice is cooked through before serving.
